By combining macroeconomic industry analysis with microeconomic consumer survey data, we aim to answer two critical strategic questions:\n\nHow do we scale? Determining the pricing power and adoption drivers for AV technology.\nWhat are the risks? Understanding consumer fears, regulatory preferences, and ethical friction points.",

Consumers currently demand a discount for the perceived risk of AVs. * Trust Leverage: High confidence in safety correlates strongly with higher WTP. Therefore, the most effective scaling strategy is Trust-Building, not just price-cutting.\n\n\n5.1.2 The Liability Landscape (Objective 2)\n\nCorporate Responsibility: The public overwhelmingly assigns blame to the AV Company rather than the programmer or the government. This signals that the industry must carry heavy insurance and liability protections.\nRegulation: There is a clear mandate for Government oversight. Strategies that attempt to bypass regulation will face significant public backlash.",
