# Autonomous Vehicles: Strategy & Ethics

**A Data-Driven Analysis of the 2025 Consumer Landscape**

## About This Report

This interactive Quarto book serves as a comprehensive strategic review of the Autonomous Vehicle (AV) industry. By combining macroeconomic industry analysis with microeconomic consumer survey data, we aim to answer two critical strategic questions:

1.  **How do we scale?** Determining the pricing power and adoption drivers for AV technology.
2.  **What are the risks?** Understanding consumer fears, regulatory preferences, and ethical friction points.

## Objectives

-   **Industry Context:** Provide a high-level view of the market players, value proposition, and competitive forces.
-   **Objective 1 (Strategy):** Evaluate Willingness to Pay (WTP) and trust dynamics to formulate a scaling strategy.
-   **Objective 2 (Ethics):** Analyze public sentiment regarding regulation, accident liability, and safety risks.

## Methodology

This report utilizes R for statistical analysis, leveraging T-tests, ANOVA, and Chi-Square tests to validate strategic insights derived from a survey of \~600 respondents.
