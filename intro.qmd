# Industry Strategic Review

This section provides the macroeconomic context for the analysis, evaluating the business landscape of the Autonomous Vehicle industry.

## Industry Overview

The Autonomous Vehicle (AV) industry is currently transitioning from the "Trough of Disillusionment" to the "Slope of Enlightenment" (Gartner Hype Cycle). While early predictions of widespread Level 5 autonomy by 2020 failed to materialize, the market is now seeing tangible commercial deployments in geofenced areas.

  * **Market Size:** Estimated at ~$100 Billion in 2024, projected to grow at a CAGR of >25% through 2030.
  * **Key Shift:** The business model is shifting from **Asset Ownership** (selling cars to individuals) to **Transportation-as-a-Service (TaaS)** (selling rides via robotaxi fleets).

## Major Players

The competitive landscape is bifurcated into two main approaches:

1.  **The "Lidar & Maps" Camp (Robotaxis):**

      * **Waymo (Alphabet):** The current market leader with fully driverless commercial operations.
      * **Cruise (GM):** A major player focusing on dense urban robotaxi fleets.
      * **Zoox (Amazon):** Developing purpose-built carriages for urban transport.

2.  **The "Vision-Only" Camp (Consumer AV):**

      * **Tesla:** Pursuing a "march of nines" approach using camera-only data from consumer fleets to train neural networks.

## Value Proposition

The value drivers differ by customer segment:

| Segment | Primary Value Proposition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Consumer (Rider)** | **Safety:** Removing human error. <br> **Productivity:** Reclaiming commute time. |
| **Business (Operator)** | **Unit Economics:** Removing the driver (approx. 70% of ride cost). <br> **Utilization:** 24/7 asset uptime. |

## Porter's Five Forces Analysis

1.  **Threat of New Entrants (Low):** Massive capital and data barriers.
2.  **Bargaining Power of Suppliers (High):** Dependence on specialized chips (Nvidia) and sensors.
3.  **Bargaining Power of Buyers (Medium):** Fleet operators have negotiating power; individual riders do not.
4.  **Threat of Substitutes (High):** Remote work, public transit, and micromobility.
5.  **Rivalry Among Competitors (High):** Winner-take-most dynamics for regulatory approval and network effects.

## Survey Data Overview

To validate these strategic assumptions, we use the `AVsurvey.csv` dataset.

```{r}
#| label: setup-data
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(DT)

# Load Data
df <- read.csv("./data/AVsurvey.csv")

# Data Cleaning
# Ensure factors are ordered for subsequent chapters
df$conf_safe <- factor(df$conf_safe, 
                       levels = c("Not very confident", "Somewhat confident", "Very confident", "Extremely confident"))
df$conf_right <- factor(df$conf_right, 
                        levels = c("Not very confident", "Somewhat confident", "Very confident", "Extremely confident"))
