While early predictions of widespread Level 5 autonomy by 2020 failed to materialize, the market is now seeing tangible commercial deployments in geofenced areas.\n\n-   **Market Size:** Estimated at \\~\\$100 Billion in 2024, projected to grow at a CAGR of \\>25% through 2030.\n-   **Key Shift:** The business model is shifting from **Asset Ownership** (selling cars to individuals) to **Transportation-as-a-Service (TaaS)** (selling rides via robotaxi fleets).\n\n![](images/Industry%20Strategic%20Review%20-%20visual%20selection.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"100%\"}\n\n## Major Players\n\nThe competitive landscape is bifurcated into two main approaches:\n\n1.  **The \"Lidar & Maps\" Camp (Robotaxis):**\n\n    -   **Waymo (Alphabet):** The current market leader with fully driverless commercial operations.\n    -   **Cruise (GM):** A major player focusing on dense urban robotaxi fleets.\n    -   **Zoox (Amazon):** Developing purpose-built carriages for urban transport.\n\n2.  **The \"Vision-Only\" Camp (Consumer AV):**\n\n    -   **Tesla:** Pursuing a \"march of nines\" approach using camera-only data from consumer fleets to train neural networks.\n\n![](images/Industry%20Strategic%20Review%20-%20visual%20selection%20(1).png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"100%\"}\n\n## Value Proposition\n\nThe value drivers differ by customer segment:\n\n| Segment | Primary Value Proposition |\n|:-----------------------------------|:-----------------------------------|\n| **Consumer (Rider)** | **Safety:** Removing human error. <br> **Productivity:** Reclaiming commute time. |\n| **Business (Operator)** | **Unit Economics:** Removing the driver (approx. 70% of ride cost). <br> **Utilization:** 24/7 asset uptime. |\n\n![](images/Industry%20Strategic%20Review%20-%20visual%20selection%20(2).png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"100%\"}\n\n## Porter's Five Forces Analysis\n\n1.  **Threat of New Entrants (Low):** Massive capital and data barriers.\n2.  **Bargaining Power of Suppliers (High):** Dependence on specialized chips (Nvidia) and sensors.\n3.  **Bargaining Power of Buyers (Medium):** Fleet operators have negotiating power; individual riders do not.\n4.  **Threat of Substitutes (High):** Remote work, public transit, and micromobility.\n5.  **Rivalry Among Competitors (High):** Winner-take-most dynamics for regulatory approval and network effects.\n\n![](images/Industry%20Strategic%20Review%20-%20visual%20selection%20(3).png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"100%\"}\n\n## Survey Data Overview\n\nTo validate these strategic assumptions, we use the `AVsurvey.csv` dataset.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"datatables html-widget html-fill-item\"
